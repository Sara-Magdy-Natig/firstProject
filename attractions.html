          <h2>el gouna</h2>
          <p>
            El Gouna's buildings were designed by European and American
             architects to resemble traditional rural Egyptian architecture such as that found in the
             Egyptian countryside and in Nubian villages. El Gouna
              specializes in watersports. There are several beaches
              including Zeytuna Beach (Arabic: شاطئ زيتونة) located on its own island
              , Mangroovy Beach, Moods Beach and other hotel beaches.
             There are three main areas in El Gouna, Downtown,
             Tamr Henna Square (Arabic: ميدان تمر حنة)
              and the Abu Tig Marina (Arabic: مارينا أبو تيج).
